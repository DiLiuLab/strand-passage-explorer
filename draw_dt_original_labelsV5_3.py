draw_dt_original_labelsV5_3.py
==============================

Draw a smooth planar oriented link diagram from a signed Dowker-Thistlethwaite
(DT) code while preserving the original traversal labels supplied by the user.

V5.3 changes
------------
* 3D projection surface wireframe is now configurable: 'grid density' (number
  of meridians; parallels follow at about half; 0 hides the mesh -- needs
  'Redraw 3D projection' since the mesh is built with the curve), and 'grid
  color' / 'grid line width' (any matplotlib colour; applied live from the
  cache).  CLI: --proj-grid-density / --proj-grid-color / --proj-grid-lw.
* The neutral framework chords connecting the crossing anchors can be shown or
  hidden independently of the wireframe ('framework chords' checkbox /
  --proj-hide-chords), so the mapped shape can be shown as surface + anchors
  only.
* Mouse roll in the live projection window: RIGHT-drag (or Shift+left-drag)
  rotates the image about the view axis, pivoting on the canvas centre --
  complementing the left-drag azimuth/elevation rotation and wheel zoom.
* Projection crossing anchor dots are now optional and hidden by default
  ('crossing anchor dots' checkbox / --proj-crossing-dots).
* The mapped-surface grid can be locked to the last projection rebuild view
  while live orbit/roll rotates the strands ('fixed grid while rotating'
  checkbox / --proj-fixed-grid).

V5.2 changes
------------
* Mapped skeleton REDONE to match score_diagram's sphere panels: 'show mapped
  skeleton' now renders the WHOLE mapped surface as a light depth-shaded
  wireframe (the actual sphere / ellipsoid / cylinder / torus the strands ride
  on, produced by passing a sphere grid through the same surface warp), plus a
  NEUTRAL dark-gray framework of strand chords and black depth-faded crossing
  anchors.  Component colours are reserved for the smooth strands, so the
  overlay no longer doubles the colours (that was messy).
* New 2D layout 'sphere-stereo' -- the creative route to a FLAT diagram for
  links whose rings live in orthogonal planes (Edwards-Venn AM_n) and defeat
  boundary-pinned layouts: the crossing graph is laid out on the unit sphere
  (3D Kamada-Kawai directions + gadget compaction, as in the 3D pipeline), a
  projection pole is searched that is farthest from every strand arc, and the
  whole spherical diagram is STEREOGRAPHICALLY projected from that pole.  A
  stereographic image of a spherical diagram is a genuine planar diagram, so
  near-orthogonal rings land as clean overlapping ovals instead of collapsing
  onto a pinned boundary.  Available in the GUI layout menu and --layout
  sphere-stereo; combines with 'relax passes' / 'min separation'.

V5.1 changes
------------
* 3D projection, for links whose rings lie in near-orthogonal planes (e.g. the
  Edwards-Venn AM_n family, where every axis view leaves one ring edge-on):
  - 'Auto view' (--proj-auto-view): searches the view sphere for the direction
    that maximizes the WORST component's projected roundness (isoperimetric
    ratio of its projected loop), i.e. the view where no ring degenerates to a
    sliver.  Button in the 3D-view tab and the projection window.
  - 'depth fade' (--proj-depth-fade, 0..1): score_diagram-style depth cueing --
    nearer strand chunks are opaque, farther ones fade.  Applied to strands
    and skeleton alike; makes front/back of an edge-on ring distinguishable.
  - 'perspective' (--proj-perspective, 0 = orthographic, else camera distance
    in scene radii, e.g. 2-4): foreshortening turns an edge-on ring into an
    open lens instead of a flat line, like a real 3D viewer.
* Mapped skeleton is now the WHOLE framework in the style of
  score_diagramV2_0's sphere panels: every strand chord drawn as a smooth arc
  through its connector anchor, in its component colour, with per-segment
  depth transparency, plus depth-faded crossing anchor dots.  New 'skeleton
  only' mode (--proj-skeleton-only) shows just this framework, which makes the
  global SHAPE of a difficult link clear at a glance.
* Projection window: mouse DRAG ROTATES the view (Chimera-like: horizontal
  drag = azimuth, vertical = elevation; live fast redraw while dragging, full
  halo render on release), and the scroll wheel zooms about the view centre.

V5.0 changes
------------
* 2D, holed-tutte: new 'ring equalize' (--ring-equalize, 0..1).  The harmonic
  (Tutte) solve compresses interior detail toward the pinned rims on large
  diagrams (e.g. the 80-crossing closed fishtail), which is why strands crowd
  at the boundary.  Ring equalize histogram-equalizes the crossings' radial
  positions across the ring width (angles kept), spreading the strands evenly
  between the rims.  1 = fully even.  Applied before invert-ring / ring-tilt.
* 2D, all layouts: planarity-guarded relaxation ('relax passes' / 'relax
  strength', --relax-passes / --relax-strength).  Each pass moves non-pinned
  nodes toward their neighbours' centroid while equalizing incident edge
  lengths, and is REJECTED (step halved) if it would introduce any
  straight-edge crossing, so the layout stays planar by construction.  Evens
  out crowded/stretched regions on difficult structures.
* New '3D view' tab + persistent '3D projection' window: an illustrative 2D
  orthographic projection of the 3D Sphere-XYZ curve, drawn depth-ordered with
  white halos so nearer strands read as crossing over farther ones -- a
  presentation method for links with no readable flat diagram (e.g. the
  Edwards-Venn Brunnian links).  The expensive 3D construction runs only on
  'Redraw 3D projection'; the quick-view buttons re-project the cached curve
  instantly.
* 3D view: optional 'mapped skeleton' overlay (crossing anchors of the sphere
  layout + strand chords, warped like the curve, with optional crossing IDs)
  to relate the 3D picture crossing-by-crossing to the 2D diagram.
* 'Save projection(s)' writes selected views (current/top/front/side) as
  SVG+PNG next to the XYZ file; 'Save XYZ' can include them automatically.
  CLI: --save-projections, --proj-views, --proj-elev/azim/roll,
  --proj-skeleton, --proj-skeleton-ids, --proj-line-width.
* UI: 'View XYZ' moved to the '3D view' tab; save-button row decluttered;
  sessions include all new parameters and still load V4.x session files.

V4.5 changes
------------
* GUI: the right-hand parameter panel is now split into two tabs -- "2D diagram"
  (layout / tutte / holed-tutte / drawing options / crossing order & map) and
  "3D XYZ" (sphere layout and surface / smoothing parameters) -- so only the
  relevant fields are shown at a time instead of one long scrolling list.  Each
  tab scrolls independently.

V4.4 changes
------------
* holed-tutte now builds the balanced 'closed principal curve' from a 3D torus
  layout: a 3D Kamada-Kawai layout naturally arranges a symmetric multi-component
  link on a torus, and its azimuth about the torus axis (the longitudinal 'long way
  around', recovered by PCA) is spread far more evenly than a 2D layout -- so links
  like the 4BL / C5BL / L6BL / 6-component come out as near-perfectly symmetric
  wreaths.  The top-down projection of that torus is the annulus (outer equator ->
  outer rim, inner equator -> inner rim); its two boundary cycles are pinned to the
  holed shape and the interior is Tutte-solved, then refined by a few fixed-point
  rounds.  When a link is not annular this way (or SciPy is missing) it falls back
  to the circular-Tutte probe, which still forces a clean annulus.
* GUI: the Output-image and Sphere-XYZ path fields were removed (the Save buttons
  prompt for the directory and filename), and the 'Save all' button was removed.
* holed-tutte: the 3D torus layout is now deterministic (seeded) and cached per
  crossing graph, so it is only recomputed when the DT code changes -- tweaking
  rotate / swap / hole ratio / ring tilt no longer re-rolls the 3D layout, and the
  diagram stays put instead of jumping.
* Orientation arrowheads now scale with the strand line width (in both the live
  preview and the saved image), instead of a fixed size.
* holed-tutte: new 'invert ring (inside-out)' option (--invert-ring) that turns the
  ring inside-out by reflecting each crossing's radius about the ring mid-line, so
  the inner boundary ends up outside and vice versa.  This is distinct from 'swap
  inner/outer face', which instead re-solves with the two boundary faces exchanged.
* GUI: the Save image / Save table / Save XYZ buttons now always open a Save-As
  dialog for the directory and filename (like 'Save as session').
* GUI: 'Refresh 2D' is now 'Redraw 2D' -- it clears the cached 3D-torus layout and
  rerolls its seed, so holed-tutte is recomputed from scratch (a fresh layout) even
  when no parameter changed.  Normal parameter tweaks still reuse the cached layout.
* GUI: the DT code box is kept on a single line -- line breaks from a multi-line
  paste are stripped automatically.
* The DT parser tolerates look-alike Unicode dashes (math minus, en/em dash, ...)
  and non-ASCII spaces pasted from documents.
* holed-tutte 'ring tilt' (0-90 deg) is now a bucket view: the flat annulus is the
  top-down view of a bucket whose wall carries the crossings.  At 90 (default) you
  look straight down -> the flat top-view wreath (closed principal curve around the
  whole circumference).  Lower tilts rotate the bucket about the horizontal axis so
  the wall opens toward a side view.  The tilt lifts each crossing onto the 3D
  bucket wall and projects it, so it is intrinsic to the mapping, not a post-hoc
  rotation of the finished picture.
* The shaped-tutte / holed-tutte shape menu drops the redundant 'circle' and
  'rectangle' choices: an ellipse at aspect 1 already is a circle, and a rounded
  rectangle at corner radius 0 already is a sharp rectangle.  Only 'ellipse' and
  'rounded-rectangle' are offered now (old saved sessions naming circle/rectangle
  still load and render).
* GUI: 'Save session' is now 'Save as session', and 'Quit' moved to a second row
  of the save-button area.

V4.3 changes
------------
* New standalone 2D layout "holed-tutte": instead of pinning a single outer face
  to a convex boundary, it pins TWO faces -- the outer face and an auto-picked
  central 'hole' face -- to the outer and inner outlines of a holed shape
  (annulus / elliptical or rectangular ring) and harmonically solves the ring, so
  the diagram wraps around a central hole along its natural closed principal
  curved axis.  Controls: shape / aspect / orient (as in shaped-tutte), a 'hole
  ratio' (inner/outer size), and a 'swap inner/outer' checkbox.  The shape-outline
  overlay shows both ring outlines; the PCA-axis overlay shows the mid-ring curved
  axis.
* GUI: when 'tutte auto aspect' is on, the panel now shows the computed aspect
  value next to the checkbox (for shaped-tutte and holed-tutte).
* Crossing-ID circles are now sized to snugly enclose the ID text (measured text
  extent plus a small margin) instead of a fixed, over-large data fraction.
* New 'min separation' control: a post-layout relaxation pushes apart non-incident
  strand pieces that sit closer than the given fraction of the diagram span (with
  a spring back to the original layout), opening up shallow / near-parallel runs.
  0 = off.

V4.2 changes
------------
* GUI: new "Save session" / "Load session" buttons write and restore every
  setting/parameter on the panel to a JSON file, so a full working session can be
  reproduced later.
* GUI: the signed DT code (?) help now states that the default code is the 4BL
  diagram and lists ready-to-copy example codes (TK, HL, BR, C5BL, L6BL); the help
  popup is sized larger to hold them.
* Crossing-ID circles are now drawn at the same data-space size in both the live
  preview and the saved image, and remain true circle objects in the SVG (an
  unfilled Circle patch) rather than being flattened into an expanded path.
* GUI: editing any Sphere XYZ (3D-only) setting no longer triggers an automatic
  2D preview redraw, so those fields respond smoothly without lag.  The 2D preview
  still refreshes for every setting that actually affects it.

V4.1 changes
------------
* Auto orientation and auto aspect are independent toggles for both the 2D
  shaped-tutte layout and the 3D shaped-kamada surface.  Either can be auto while
  the other is set manually.  (Auto aspect measures the diagram's own elongation
  via PCA -- the ratio of its spread along its long vs. short principal axis --
  and sizes the boundary / surface proportions to match it; it does not equalize
  strand lengths.)
* 2D shaped-tutte orientation is always relative to the diagram's PCA elongation
  axis and works for every boundary shape.  Auto orient puts the PCA axis along
  the view x-axis; when it is off, a manual 'tutte orient' angle rotates from the
  PCA axis.  The global 'rotate degrees' still applies on top.
* 3D shaped-kamada has two manual orientation controls, both relative to the PCA
  axis and used when auto orient is off: 'surface orient' spins the mapping about
  the surface's primary axis, and 'surface tilt' rotates that primary axis away
  from the PCA axis (about the perpendicular secondary axis).
* 2D decompression now has two independent controls: 'tutte decompress' (the
  original boundary-depth weighting, referenced to the boundary/shape) and a new
  'tutte COM expand' that radially expands interior structure about the crossing
  center of mass so crowded crossings get more room and sit near the center.
* Help (?) text for the new shaped-layout parameters states the suggested range
  and whether the value is an absolute distance or a dimensionless ratio; the
  short hints that used to sit under some fields were folded into their ? help.
* The figure-size help now reports the current live-preview panel size.
* The DPI field was removed from the GUI (vector SVG/PDF output is the common
  case); PNG raster export still uses the command-line --dpi default.

V4.0 changes
------------
* 2D: new "shaped-tutte" layout.  The Tutte (barycentric) boundary can now be a
  circle, an ellipse, a rectangle, or a rounded rectangle with an adjustable
  aspect ratio and corner radius, instead of only a circle.  With auto mode on
  (default), the boundary aspect is derived from the diagram's own elongation
  and the finished diagram is rotated so its principal (PCA) axis lies
  horizontally, i.e. it is automatically oriented along the elongation axis.
* 2D: both "tutte" and "shaped-tutte" gain an internal-decompression weight.
  A single strength value (0 = classic Tutte) applies boundary-depth edge
  weights in a convex-combination Tutte solve, which pushes interior structure
  outward so it is not over-compressed toward the center.  Positive weights keep
  the barycentric map valid, so no new crossings are introduced by the weighting.
* 3D: new "shaped-kamada" sphere layout.  The sphere-native spherical-kamada
  construction is warped onto other closed/oriented surfaces -- an ellipsoid, a
  cylinder, or a torus -- with the over/under crossing offset applied along the
  local surface normal.  Auto mode (default) aligns the surface's principal axis
  to the diagram (3D PCA) and derives the surface aspect / tube ratio from the
  diagram's own shape; manual mode exposes the shape parameters directly.
* GUI: parameter fields that do not apply to the current 2D layout / sphere
  layout / shape are now dynamically greyed out (disabled), so only relevant
  controls are active.

V3.14 changes
-------------
* The chosen 2D layout is now kept as requested even when it introduces false
  crossings -- there is no automatic fallback to 'planar'.  This preserves, for
  example, a "failed" kamada layout for inspection.
* False crossings (accidental strand overlaps a layout adds away from true DT
  crossings) are now drawn with the same over/under gap style as real crossings.
  The over/under choice there is arbitrary (chosen deterministically), since a
  false crossing is not a real DT crossing.
* A red warning listing the number of false crossings is shown on the live
  preview and saved into the exported image/SVG.
* The diagram metadata (script name/version and essential facts) is now also
  drawn as a visible caption at the bottom of the saved image, in addition to
  being written as file metadata.

V3.13 changes
-------------
* Over/under gaps now render correctly on self-crossings (e.g. the trefoil
  DT: [(4,6,2)]).  Local crossing pieces are selected by arc length along the
  curve parameter instead of by spatial distance, so a component that passes
  through one crossing twice no longer re-covers its own under-strand gap.
* Saved diagrams embed metadata: the generating script name and version plus
  essential facts (component and crossing counts and the key drawing
  parameters).  For SVG these appear in the file's <metadata> block.
* GUI: the Signed DT code box (now two lines) and the output-image / Sphere-XYZ
  path fields sit at the top of the left column, directly above the live
  preview, where long values have full width.  The Sphere XYZ parameter section
  moved to the bottom of the right panel.  The mouse wheel now scrolls the right
  parameter panel.  The CSV table field was removed -- "Save table" writes the
  table beside the output image with the same name and a .csv extension.  The
  redundant "Refresh preview" button was removed ("Refresh 2D" remains).

V3.12 changes
-------------
* Editable SVG/PDF text now uses Arial consistently during preview rendering and
  file export, reducing font-metric differences when the result is opened in
  Illustrator.
* DT traversal-label boxes and crossing-ID circles have larger default padding,
  so their outlines do not look too tight around editable text in the final SVG.

V3.11 changes
-------------
* Adds optional Tk window/task-menu icon support.  GUI mode tries to load
  ``assets/strand_passage_icon.png`` when it is present, but silently continues
  without an icon if the asset is missing or the local Tk build cannot read it.

V3.10 changes
-------------
* The saved 2-D image (SVG/PDF/PNG) now reproduces the live GUI preview.  Both
  paths share one content-framing routine (``apply_content_framing``): the live
  preview and the file-save use the same content bounds, padding, preview zoom,
  and panel aspect ratio, so "what you see is what you save".  Previously the
  preview reframed the diagram to the wide Tk canvas (aspect ratio + interactive
  zoom) while the file was written from a square figure cropped with
  ``bbox_inches='tight'``, so the two looked different even though the knot
  geometry (Tutte layout) was identical.
* Adds module-level defaults ``DEFAULT_LAYOUT`` / ``DEFAULT_Y_DIRECTION`` /
  ``DEFAULT_ROTATE`` as a single source of truth for the 2-D drawing settings,
  which external consumers (e.g. the strand-passage engine) reuse so their
  diagrams match this helper's default output.

V3.9 exports a spherical 3D polyline coordinate file. By default, the
spherical coordinates are produced from a 3D Kamada-Kawai-style graph layout and
then projected to a sphere. Direct connecting remains on by default for
spherical-kamada, so connector segments travel smoothly between the inner and
outer crossing layers instead of returning to the middle sphere layer. V3.9
keeps the in-GUI 3D XYZ viewer and 2D preview zoom/rotation controls.
V3.9 also improves SVG post-editability: text stays as SVG text, component
strands are exported as closed stroked paths with local white gap masks, and
clipping masks are avoided.  Crossing IDs stay fixed at their true crossing
centers, while DT labels are moved outward when needed so the original traversal
labels remain visible. The older stereographic mapping from the 2D drawing is
still available with --sphere-layout stereographic.

Inputs:
  --dt       signed DT code, for example
             'DT: [(-8,-12,16),(-24,-22,-28,-26),(-10,-14,-2),(-20,-6,-18,-4)]'
  --output   output image path (.svg, .pdf, .png, etc.)
  --table    optional CSV mapping table

Outputs:
  A link diagram image with original odd/even DT traversal labels, optional
  crossing IDs, orientation arrows, over/under gaps, an optional CSV table,
  and a spherical XYZ coordinate file with blank lines between components.

Example:
  python draw_dt_original_labelsV4_5.py \
    --dt 'DT: [(-8,-12,16),(-24,-22,-28,-26),(-10,-14,-2),(-20,-6,-18,-4)]' \
    --output example_v3.svg \
    --table example_v3.csv \
    --xyz-output example_v3.xyz \
    --show-crossing-ids \
    --crossing-order 'c1 c7 c14 c12 c3 c6 c9 c5 c11 c13 c4 c2 c10 c8' \
    --color-crossing-ids-by-overstrand

If no command-line arguments are supplied, or if --gui is supplied, the script
opens a Tkinter GUI with a live diagram preview panel.

Python 3.9 compatible. Dependencies: numpy, networkx, matplotlib.
Tkinter is needed only for GUI mode.

    harmonic (barycentric) system -- a discrete harmonic map onto the ring -- so
    the diagram wraps around a central hole along its natural closed 'principal
    curved axis'.

    The outer face is the largest planar face; the hole is an auto-picked central,
    encircling face (see _pick_hole_face).  ``swap`` exchanges which cycle is
    pinned to the outer vs. inner outline.  ``hole_ratio`` in (0,1) sets the inner

    ``corner_radius``/``orient_degrees`` behave as in shaped_tutte_layout and apply
    to both outlines.

    ``meta_out``, when given, is filled with ``boundary_outer``, ``boundary_inner``
    and ``medial`` (the mid-ring closed curved axis) in the returned frame.

    The angular distribution of the crossings around the ring (the 'closed
    principal curve') is taken from a Kamada-Kawai layout of the crossing graph,
    which spreads the components evenly around the diagram, so the ring is balanced
    instead of lopsided.  ``ring_tilt`` then views the resulting ring as the wall of
    a bucket: 90 deg looks straight down (flat top-view annulus), lower values tilt
    the bucket so its wall opens toward a side view.  The tilt lifts each crossing
    onto the 3D bucket wall and projects it, so it is intrinsic to the mapping (not
    a post-hoc rotation of the finished picture).
