# DT Link Toolkit

DT Link Toolkit is a research toolkit for studying knots and links given by a
signed **Dowker-Thistlethwaite (DT) code**. It includes strand-passage
exploration, DT drawing, SnapPy/Sage comparison and database-search helpers, and
diagram scoring.

The main feature is component-colour preservation: the identity of each original
link component is tracked through chained passages and simplifications, so the
same component can be followed across a branching exploration.

## What It Does

- **Interactive GUI:** load a DT code, click a crossing, and open a new diagram
  window for the after-passage result. Each result window is clickable, so
  passages can branch and chain.
- **Batch mode (`--nongui`):** run all one- and two-step strand passages, writing
  an Excel spreadsheet and an overview SVG.
- **Demo mode (`--demo`):** render a headless before/after cascade image.
- **SnapPy/Sage path:** use SnapPy simplification, Jones polynomials, linking
  invariants, and component-colour recovery.
- **Continuity fallback:** the scripts still run without Sage/SnapPy, but Jones
  polynomials and SnapPy-based colour matching are unavailable.

Development notes and version history are in [DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md](DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md).

```

## Install

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiLiuLab/dt_strand_passage_explorer.git
cd dt_strand_passage_explorer
```

`git clone` downloads the project into a new folder and sets `origin` to the
GitHub repository, so future updates know where to come from.

The repository slug remains `dt_strand_passage_explorer` for continuity, even
though the project name is now DT Link Toolkit.

Install the regular Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For full functionality, run with **Sage + SnapPy**:

```bash
sage -python strand_passage_guiV4_0.py --help
```

SnapPy is intentionally not pinned in `requirements.txt`, because this project
is intended to use the SnapPy/Sage installation on the research machine.

## Run

Interactive GUI:

```bash
sage -python strand_passage_guiV4_0.py
sage -python strand_passage_guiV4_0.py --dt "DT: [(4,6,2)]"
```

If the TkAgg backend is not available:

```bash
python3 strand_passage_guiV4_0.py --gui-backend agg
```

Batch spreadsheet and overview SVG:

```bash
sage -python strand_passage_guiV4_0.py --nongui \
  --dt "DT: [(-8,-12,16),(-24,-22,-28,-26),(-10,-14,-2),(-20,-6,-18,-4)]" \
  --out strand_passage_results.xlsx
```

For one-crossing components, use Python tuple syntax with a trailing comma:
`DT: [(4,), (2,)]`, not `DT: [(4), (2)]`.  The latter is ambiguous because
Python reads `(4)` as the integer `4`.

In `--nongui` mode, `--out` controls both output files. If you set:

```text
--out /path/to/name.xlsx
```

the script writes:

```text
/path/to/name.xlsx
/path/to/name_overview.svg
```

If the path does not end in `.xlsx`, the script adds it first. For example,
`--out results/run1` writes `results/run1.xlsx` and
`results/run1_overview.svg`. To choose the SVG directory and basename, choose the
directory and basename of the spreadsheet path.

Custom displayed crossing IDs use the same syntax as
`draw_dt_original_labelsV5_3.py`.  V4.0 adds a combined
`--crossing-labels` option: assignment-style text is detected as a crossing map,
while a plain list is detected as crossing order.

```bash
sage -python strand_passage_guiV4_0.py \
  --dt "DT: [(4,6,2)]" \
  --crossing-labels "c1 c3 c2"
```

For the built-in 14-crossing example, the crossing-order CLI option can be set
as:

```bash
sage -python strand_passage_guiV4_0.py \
  --crossing-labels "c1 c7 c14 c12 c3 c6 c9 c5 c11 c13 c4 c2 c10 c8"
```

`--crossing-labels` lists displayed crossing IDs in odd-label order
`1,3,5,...`.  Alternatively, use assignment text such as
`--crossing-labels "c1=1,c3=3,c2=5"`.  The old `--crossing-order` and
`--crossing-map` options still work. In the GUI, use the single
`Crossing labels` field. These labels affect the drawing and passage notes only;
the internal strand-passage calculation still uses the underlying DT crossing ids.

Drawing settings:

- V4.0 defaults strand-passage drawings to `shaped-tutte` with `tutte shape =
  ellipse` and `tutte aspect = 1.0`.
- In the GUI, click `Load drawing session` to load a JSON session saved by
  `draw_dt_original_labelsV5_3.py`. The saved 2-D drawing settings then apply to
  the root diagram and following strand-passage diagrams.
- In batch/demo modes, use `--drawing-session path/to/session.json`. If the
  session contains a DT code it is used when `--dt` is not supplied; explicit
  `--dt` stays higher priority.
- Each diagram window has a `Simplify` button. It simplifies that current diagram
  with the active SnapPy/backtrack settings and refreshes the properties panel,
  including Jones data when Sage/SnapPy can compute it.

Spreadsheet columns to know:

- `DT_code_chosen` is the visible DT code used for the drawn structure and for
  any next passage step.
- The second pass is run once for each merged first-step structure,
  not once for every raw first-step crossing. A first-step result is continued
  when `new_components > 2` and it has a usable `DT_code_chosen`; the CLI prints
  this criterion and the resulting continuation counts. Second-pass sheets are
  named `merged_<node>_<labels...>`, and the columns `first_step_passages` and
  `first_step_representative` show which first-step crossings merged together
  and which representative was continued.
- The `run_info` sheet records the software version, engine/drawing modules,
  runtime, command/arguments, output paths, key parameters, second-pass
  continuation criterion, and continuation counts for that workbook.
- Before a pass is enumerated, the source DT is simplified to the representative
  used for that pass's crossing-count baseline. This keeps continuation rows
  from being generated on a higher-crossing stale parent and prevents invalid
  `increase` outcomes.
- `Jones_polynomial` is computed from that exact visible DT code, so pasting
  `DT_code_chosen` into Sage/SnapPy should give the same polynomial.
- `topological_Jones_polynomial` records the SnapPy simplified link object
  before its visible DT export. When `hidden_split_unknots` is greater than
  zero, this polynomial includes the extra split-circle factor, while
  `Jones_polynomial` describes the crossing-bearing DT code that can be drawn.
- `visible_components` is the component count in the exported/drawn DT code.
  `topological_components` is the component count before any zero-crossing
  split unknots are omitted from the DT export.

Headless cascade figure:

```bash
python3 strand_passage_guiV4_0.py --dt "DT: [(4,6,2)]" --demo 2 1 --out chain.png
```

Standalone DT comparison utility:

```bash
sage -python check_two_dt.py
sage -python check_two_dt.py --help
sage -python check_two_dt.py \
  --dt1 "DT: [(4,6,2)]" \
  --dt2 "DT: [(-4,-6,-2)]" \
  --rounds 300 --steps 25 --target 10
```

`check_two_dt.py` compares two signed DT codes using simplified crossing and
component counts, linking/Jones/Alexander invariants when Sage supports them,
exterior isometry, an explicit mirror check, and optional randomized
backtrack+simplify diagnostics. Run `--help` for the full CLI.

SnapPy database search utility:

```bash
sage -python find_link_in_snappy.py --dt "DT: [(4,6,2)]" --output matches.tsv
sage -python find_link_in_snappy.py --input links.tsv --output matches.tsv
```

`find_link_in_snappy.py` searches SnapPy's `HTLinkExteriors` and
`LinkExteriors` databases for links matching one or more DT codes. For each
query it compares, in order: extended alphabetic DT code with flip data, exact
numeric DT code, optional loose numeric DT code, and then meridian-preserving
exterior identification for hyperbolic links. Use `--strict` to disable the
loose numeric fallback. Input files may contain one DT code per line, or
`label<TAB>DT_code`; output is a TSV table.

Diagram scoring utility:

```bash
sage -python score_diagramV2_0.py --help
sage -python score_diagramV2_0.py \
  --dt "DT: [(4,6,2)]" \
  --rounds 0 \
  --checkpoint results/score_chain.jsonl \
  --xlsx results/diagram_scores.xlsx \
  --svg results/diagram_scores.svg \
  --json results/diagram_scores.json
```

With no arguments, `score_diagramV2_0.py` opens a small Tk GUI for configuring a
run. The tool generates alternative simplified DT diagrams of the same link,
deduplicates signed diagram isomorphs, scores each representative, and writes an
Excel workbook plus optional SVG/JSON reports. Long runs can use
`--generate-only --max-seconds N` and resume from the checkpoint.

## Pull Updates

To update an existing clone:

```bash
git pull
```

`git pull` asks GitHub for new commits on the current branch and applies them to
your local copy. If you have local edits, commit or save them first so Git can
merge cleanly.

To see what changed after pulling:

```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

## Executable Use

The repository includes a launcher:

```bash
./bin/strand-passage --help
./bin/strand-passage --dt "DT: [(4,6,2)]"
```

The launcher uses `sage -python` when Sage is available, and falls back to
`python3` otherwise.

To make the Python scripts directly executable on macOS/Linux:

```bash
chmod +x strand_passage_guiV4_0.py
chmod +x draw_dt_original_labelsV5_3.py
chmod +x check_two_dt.py
chmod +x find_link_in_snappy.py
```

Then they can be run as:

```bash
./strand_passage_guiV4_0.py --gui-backend agg
```

For SnapPy/Jones functionality, prefer:

```bash
sage -python ./strand_passage_guiV4_0.py
```

## Notes

- Backtrack-assisted simplification is on by default: 200 rounds x 30 steps.
  Use `--no-backtrack`, `--backtrack-rounds N`, or `--backtrack-steps K` to
  tune it.
- A negative even DT label means the even visit is the over strand by default.
  Use `--negative-even under` for the opposite convention.
- Generated outputs such as `*.xlsx`, `*_overview*.svg`, `*.xyz`,
  `link_diagram.*`, `chain*.jsonl`, `diagram_scores*`, `canonical_cache.json`,
  `results/`, and cascade PNGs are ignored by Git.
- The `--nongui` overview SVG keeps labels and captions as editable text using
  Arial, so text can be selected and edited in Illustrator/Inkscape. V3.8 also
  enlarges the surrounding label boxes/circles so the exported SVG better
  matches the live Matplotlib view in Illustrator.
- Standalone SVGs from `draw_dt_original_labelsV5_3.py` use the same Arial
  editable-text policy and roomier DT-label/crossing-ID boxes. V3.13 fixed
  over/under gaps at self-crossings such as the trefoil `DT: [(4,6,2)]`; V3.14
  keeps requested layouts even when they create false crossings, highlights
  those artifacts, and adds a visible metadata caption to saved diagrams. V4.5
  keeps the standalone helper GUI manageable by splitting parameters into
  separate 2-D diagram and 3-D XYZ tabs.
- In the drawing helper GUI, saved SVG font sizes follow the live GUI fields:
  `DT label font` maps to `--font-size`, and `crossing ID font` maps to
  `--crossing-id-font-size`.
- The optional icon lives in `assets/`. If it is missing, the GUI scripts still
  run normally.
